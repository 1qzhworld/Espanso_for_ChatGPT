This repository is created as an example. More prompts can be added by yourself (see recommendation of prompts in the end).



`base.yml` should replace the setting file in the path of espanso (see https://espanso.org/docs/get-started/#configuration for more details)

- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/espanso` (e.g. `/home/user/.config/espanso`)
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/espanso` (e.g.`  /Users/user/Library/Application Support/espanso`)
  - NOTE: when migrating from the previous 0.7.3 version, the configuration directory will be located in `$HOME/Library/Preferences/espanso` for compatibility purposes.
- Windows: `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}\espanso` (e.g. `C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\espanso`)



More details about the configuration can be found in official document, i.e., https://espanso.org/docs

From My Own Experience, It Should be Noted that:

'gpt2e' is not quite friendly for thesis polish and it is recommended to use 'gpt2p' for thesis polishing. Also the translation from 'gpt2e' may be too formal and traditional. If you feel so, you can deleted the label "I want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with more beautiful and elegant, upper level English words and sentences.".

Also, never expect to use chatgpt to help you write your paper! NEVER!
